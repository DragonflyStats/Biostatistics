\subsection{Influence}
Broadly
defined, ``\textit{influence}‚Äù is understood as the ability of a single or multiple data points, through their presence
or absence in the data, to alter important aspects of the analysis, yield qualitatively different inferences, or
violate assumptions of the statistical model. 


The goal of influence analysis is not primarily to mark data
points for deletion so that a better model fit can be achieved for the reduced data, although this might be a
result of influence analysis. The goal is rather to determine which cases are influential and the manner in
which they are important to the analysis. Outliers, for example, may be the most noteworthy data points in
an analysis. They can point to a model breakdown and lead to development of a better model.


\section{Influence analysis} %1.7

Likelihood based estimation methods, such as ML and REML, are sensitive to unusual observations. Influence diagnostics are formal techniques that assess the influence of observations on parameter estimates for $\beta$ and $\theta$. A common technique is to refit the model with an observation or group of observations omitted.

\emph{west} examines a group of methods that examine various aspects of influence diagnostics for LME models.
For overall influence, the most common approaches are the `likelihood distance' and the `restricted likelihood distance'.

\subsection{Cook's 1986 paper on Local Influence}%1.7.1
Cook 1986 introduced methods for local influence assessment. These methods provide a powerful tool for examining perturbations in the assumption of a model, particularly the effects of local perturbations of parameters of observations.

The local-influence approach to influence assessment is quitedifferent from the case deletion approach, comparisons are of
interest.



\subsection{Overall Influence}
An overall influence statistic measures the change in the objective function being minimized. For example, in
OLS regression, the residual sums of squares serves that purpose. In linear mixed models fit by
\index{maximum likelihood} maximum likelihood (ML) or \index{restricted maximum likelihood} restricted maximum likelihood (REML), an overall influence measure is the \index{likelihood distance} likelihood distance [Cook and Weisberg ].
