These models are used when there are both fixed and random effects that need to be incorporated into a model.

Fixed effects usually correspond to experimental treatments for which one has data for the entire population of samples corresponding to that treatment.

Random effects,on the other hand, are assigned in the case where we have measurements on a group of samples, and those
samples are taken from some larger sample pool, and are presumed to be representative.

As such, linear mixed effects models treat the error for fixed effects differently than the error for random effects.
