\subsection*{Mountain Plot}
%% http://www.clinchem.org/content/43/11/2039.long

Krouwer and Monti (29) presented a graphical method for evaluation of laboratory assays (a mountain plot). 
They computed the percentile for each ranked difference between the two methods, and by “turning” at the 50th percentile 
produced a histogram-like function (the mountain). 
This method is relevant for detecting large infrequent errors (differences) but lacks the aspect of concentration relationship. 
These investigators, therefore, recommend use of their plot together with difference plots. 
Introduction of analytical quality specifications in the mountain plots may be useful in method evaluations.
