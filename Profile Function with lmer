Profile Function with "lmer"

The profile() function for lmer models is now available in the latest version of lme4, to be installed by typing:

install.packages("lme4",repos="http://r-forge.r-project.org")

also

The mle function from the stats4 package is a wrapper of optim, which makes it quite easy to produce 
profile likelihood computations. 

See help("profile,mle-method", package = "stats4") for more information.

The profile likelihood (or likelihood or likelihood ratio) methid is applicable to 
all likelihood based statstical analysis and is generally less sensitive to the difficulties
encountered by walkd-Tyoe CIs.
