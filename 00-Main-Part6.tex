	\subsection{Overall Influence}
	An overall influence statistic measures the change in the objective function being minimized. For example, in
	OLS regression, the residual sums of squares serves that purpose. In linear mixed models fit by
	\index{maximum likelihood} maximum likelihood (ML) or \index{restricted maximum likelihood} restricted maximum likelihood (REML), an overall influence measure is the \index{likelihood distance} likelihood distance [Cook and Weisberg ].
	
	

	\subsection{Cook's 1986 paper on Local Influence}%1.7.1
	Cook 1986 introduced methods for local influence assessment. These methods provide a powerful tool for examining perturbations in the assumption of a model, particularly the effects of local perturbations of parameters of observations.
	
	The local-influence approach to influence assessment is quitedifferent from the case deletion approach, comparisons are of
	interest.
	
	
	
	\section{Measures of Influence} %1.16
	
	The impact of an observation on a regression fitting can be determined by the difference between the estimated regression coefficient of a model with all observations and the estimated coefficient when the particular observation is deleted. The measure DFBETA is the studentized value of this difference.
	
	
	\subsection{DFFITS} %1.16.1
	DFFITS is a statistical measured designed to a show how influential an observation is in a statistical model. It is closely related to the studentized residual.
	\begin{displaymath} DFFITS = {\widehat{y_i} -
		\widehat{y_{i(k)}} \over s_{(k)} \sqrt{h_{ii}}} \end{displaymath}
	
	
	\subsection{PRESS} %1.16.2
	The prediction residual sum of squares (PRESS) is an value associated with this calculation. When fitting linear models, PRESS can be used as a criterion for model selection, with smaller values indicating better model fits.
	\begin{equation}
	PRESS = \sum(y-y^{(k)})^2
	\end{equation}
	
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $e_{-Q} = y_{Q} - x_{Q}\hat{\beta}^{-Q}$
		\item $PRESS_{(U)} = y_{i} - x\hat{\beta}_{(U)}$
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection*{DFBETA} %1.16.3
	\begin{eqnarray}
	DFBETA_{a} &=& \hat{\beta} - \hat{\beta}_{(a)} \\
	&=& B(Y-Y_{\bar{a}}

	\section{Influence in LME Models}
	
	Model diagnostic techniques, well established for classical models, have since been adapted for use with linear mixed effects models. Diagnostic techniques for LME models are inevitably more difficult to implement, due to the increased complexity.
	
	\section{Influence analysis for LME Models} %1.7
	
	Likelihood based estimation methods, such as ML and REML, are sensitive to unusual observations. Influence diagnostics are formal techniques that assess the influence of observations on parameter estimates for $\beta$ and $\theta$. A common technique is to refit the model with an observation or group of observations omitted.
	
	\citet{west} examines a group of methods that examine various aspects of influence diagnostics for LME models.
	For overall influence, the most common approaches are the `likelihood distance' and the `restricted likelihood distance'.	

	\subsection{Influence Diagnostics: Basic Idea and Statistics} %1.1.2
	%http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/statug/63033/HTML/default/viewer.htm#statug_mixed_sect024.htm
	
	The general idea of quantifying the influence of one or more observations relies on computing parameter estimates based on all data points, removing the cases in question from the data, refitting the model, and computing statistics based on the change between full-data and reduced-data estimation. 
	


	
	
	\subsection{Influence Analysis for LME Models} %1.1.3
	The linear mixed effects model is a useful methodology for fitting a wide range of models. However, linear mixed effects models are known to be sensitive to outliers. \citet{CPJ} advises that identification of outliers is necessary before conclusions may be drawn from the fitted model.
	
	Standard statistical packages concentrate on calculating and testing parameter estimates without considering the diagnostics of the model.The assessment of the effects of perturbations in data, on the outcome of the analysis, is known as statistical influence analysis. Influence analysis examines the robustness of the model. Influence analysis methodologies have been used extensively in classical linear models, and provided the basis for methodologies for use with LME models.
	Computationally inexpensive diagnostics tools have been developed to examine the issue of influence \citep{Zewotir}.
	Studentized residuals, error contrast matrices and the inverse of the response variance covariance matrix are regular components of these tools.
	
	Influence arises at two stages of the LME model. Firstly when $V$ is estimated by $\hat{V}$, and subsequent
	estimations of the fixed and random regression coefficients $\beta$ and $u$, given $\hat{V}$.

	%	\section{Covariance Parameters} %1.5
	%	The unknown variance elements are referred to as the covariance parameters and collected in the vector $\theta$.
	% - where is this coming from?
	% - where is it used again?
	% - Has this got anything to do with CovTrace etc?
	%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	
	
	

	\subsection{Influence Statistics for LME models} %1.1.4
	Influence statistics can be coarsely grouped by the aspect of estimation that is their primary target:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item overall measures compare changes in objective functions: (restricted) likelihood distance (Cook and Weisberg 1982, Ch. 5.2)
		\item influence on parameter estimates: Cook's  (Cook 1977, 1979), MDFFITS (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 1980, p. 32)
		\item influence on precision of estimates: CovRatio and CovTrace
		\item influence on fitted and predicted values: PRESS residual, PRESS statistic (Allen 1974), DFFITS (Belsley, Kuh, and Welsch 1980, p. 15)
		\item outlier properties: internally and externally studentized residuals, leverage
	\end{itemize}
	%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	
	Beckman, Nachtsheim and Cook (1987) \citet{Beckman} applied the \index{local influence}local influence method of Cook (1986) to the analysis of the linear mixed model.
	
	While the concept of influence analysis is straightforward, implementation in mixed models is more complex. Update formulae for fixed effects models are available only when the covariance parameters are assumed to be known.
	
	If the global measure suggests that the points in $U$ are influential, the nature of that influence should be determined. In particular, the points in $U$ can affect the following
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the estimates of fixed effects,
		\item the estimates of the precision of the fixed effects,
		\item the estimates of the covariance parameters,
		\item the estimates of the precision of the covariance parameters,
		\item fitted and predicted values.
	\end{itemize}
	%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%
	\newpage

	\subsection{What is Influence} %1.1.5
	
	Broadly defined, influence is understood as the ability of a single or multiple data points, through their presence or absence in the data, to alter important aspects of the analysis, yield qualitatively different inferences, or violate assumptions of the statistical model. The goal of influence analysis is not primarily to mark data
	points for deletion so that a better model fit can be achieved for the reduced data, although this might be a result of influence analysis \citep{schabenberger}.
	
	%-------%
	\subsection{Quantifying Influence}  %1.1.6
	
	The basic procedure for quantifying influence is simple as follows:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fit the model to the data and obtain estimates of all parameters.
		\item Remove one or more data points from the analysis and compute updated estimates of model parameters.
		\item Based on full- and reduced-data estimates, contrast quantities of interest to determine how the absence of the observations changes the analysis.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\citet{cook86} introduces powerful tools for local-influence assessment and examining perturbations in the assumptions of a model. In particular the effect of local perturbations of parameters or observations are examined.

\end{itemize}
The Andrews-Pregibon statistic $AP_{i}$ is a measure of influence based on the volume of the confidence ellipsoid.
The larger this statistic is for observation $i$, the stronger the influence that observation will have on the model fit.





\section{Haslett's Analysis} %2.5
For fixed effect linear models with correlated error structure Haslett (1999) showed that the effects on
the fixed effects estimate of deleting each observation in turn could be cheaply computed from the fixed effects model predicted residuals.


A general theory is presented for residuals from the general linear model with correlated errors.
It is demonstrated that there are two fundamental types of residual associated with this model,
referred to here as the marginal and the conditional residual.


These measure respectively the distance to the global aspects of the model as represented by the expected value
and the local aspects as represented by the conditional expected value.


These residuals may be multivariate.


\citet{HaslettHayes} developes some important dualities which have simple implications for diagnostics.


%The results are illustrated by reference to model diagnostics in time series and in classical multivariate analysis with independent cases.

To alleviate the problem caused by inconstant variance, the residuals are scaled (i.e. divided) by their standard deviations. This results in a \index{standardized residual}`standardized residual'. Because true standard deviations are frequently unknown, one can instead divide a residual by the estimated standard deviation to obtain the \index{studentized residual}`studentized residual.

\section{The Hat Matrix} %5.1

The projection matrix $H$ (also known as the hat matrix), is a

observed values $Y$, i.e. $\hat{Y} = HY$.

\begin{equation}
H =\quad X(X^{T}X)^{-1}X^{T}
\end{equation}

$H$ describes the influence each observed value has on each fitted
value. The diagonal elements of the $H$ are the `leverages', which
describe the influence each observed value has on the fitted value
for that same observation. The residuals ($R$) are related to the
observed values by the following formula:
\begin{equation}
R = (I-H)Y
\end{equation}

The variances of $Y$ and $R$ can be expressed as:
\begin{eqnarray}
\mbox{var}(Y) = H\sigma^{2} \nonumber\\
\mbox{var}(R) = (I-H)\sigma^{2}
\end{eqnarray}

Updating techniques allow an economic approach to recalculating
the projection matrix, $H$, by removing the necessity to refit the
model each time it is updated. However this approach is known for
numerical instability in the case of down-dating.

\end{equation}

This result is highly useful for analyzing regression diagnostics,
and for matrices inverses in general. Consider a $p \times p$
matrix $X$, from which a row $x_{i}^{T}$ is to be added or
deleted. \citet{CookWeisberg} sets $A = X^{T}X$, $a=-x_{i}^{T}$
and $b=x_{i}^{T}$, and writes the above equation as

\begin{equation}
(X^{T}X \pm x_{i}x_{i}^{T})^{-1} = \quad(X^{T}X )^{-1} \mp \quad
\frac{(X^{T}X)^{-1}(x_{i}x_{i}^{T}(X^{T}X)^{-1}}{1-x_{i}^{T}(X^{T}X)^{-1}x_{i}}

the projection matrix, $H$, by removing the necessity to refit the
model each time it is updated. However this approach is known for
numerical instability in the case of down-dating.


\section{Lesaffre's paper.} %5.6

Lesaffre considers the case-weight perturbation approach.


%\citep{cook86}
Cook's 86 describes a local approach wherein each case is given a weight $w_{i}$ and the effect on the parameter estimation is measured by perturbing these weights. Choosing weights close to zero or one corresponds to the global case-deletion approach.

Lesaffre  describes the displacement in log-likelihood as a useful metric to evaluate local influence %\citep{cook86}.


%\citet{lesaffre}
Lesaffre describes a framework to detect outlying observations that matter in an LME model. Detection should be carried out by evaluating diagnostics $C_{i}$ , $C_{i}(\alpha)$ and $C_{i}(D,\sigma^2)$.


Lesaffre defines the total local influence of individual $i$ as
\begin{equation}
C_{i} = 2 | \triangle \prime _{i} L^{-1} \triangle_{i}|.
\end{equation}


The influence function of the MLEs evaluated at the $i$th point $IF_{i}$, given by
\begin{equation}
IF_{i} = -L^{-1}\triangle _{i}
\end{equation}
can indicate how $\hat{theta}$ changes as the weight of the $i$th
subject changes.

The manner by which influential observations distort the estimation process can be determined by inspecting the
interpretable components in the decomposition of the above measures of local influence.


Lesaffre comments that there is no clear way of interpreting the information contained in the angles, but that this doesn't mean the information should be ignored.

\section{Cross Validation} %5.4

Cross validation techniques for linear regression employ the use `leave one out' re-calculations. In such procedures the regression coefficients are estimated for $n-1$ covariates, with the $Q^{th}$ observation omitted.

Let $\hat{\beta}$ denote the least square estimate of $\beta$ based upon the full set of observations, and let
$\hat{\beta}^{-Q}$ denoted the estimate with the $Q^{th}$ case
excluded.


In leave-one-out cross validation, each observation is omitted in turn, and a regression model is fitted on the rest of the data. Cross validation is used to estimate the generalization error of a given model. alternatively it can be used for model selection by determining the candidate model that has the smallest generalization error.


Evidently leave-one-out cross validation has similarities with `jackknifing', a well known statistical technique. However cross validation is used to estimate generalization error, whereas the jackknife technique is used to estimate bias.

\subsection{Cross Validation: Updating standard deviation} %5.4.1

The variance of a data set can be calculated using the following formula.
\begin{equation}
S^{2}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})-\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})^{2}}{n}}{n-1}
\end{equation}

While using bivariate data, the notation $Sxx$ and $Syy$ shall apply to the variance of $x$ and of $y$ respectively. The covariance term $Sxy$ is given by

\begin{equation}
Sxy=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}y_{i})-\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i})}{n}}{n-1}
\end{equation}

Let the observation $j$ be omitted from the data set. The estimates for the variance identities can be updating using minor adjustments to the full sample estimates. Where $(j)$ denotes that the $j$th has been omitted, these identities are

\begin{equation}
Sxx^{(j)}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}^{2})-(x_{j})^{2}-\frac{((\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})-x_{j})^{2}}{n-1}}{n-2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Syy^{(j)}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}^{2})-(y_{j})^{2}-\frac{((\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i})-y_{j})^{2}}{n-1}}{n-2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
Sxy^{(j)}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}y_{i})-(y_{j}x_{j})-\frac{((\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})-x_{j})(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i})-y_{k})}{n-1}}{n-2}
\end{equation}

The updated estimate for the slope is therefore
\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta}_{1}^{(j)}=\frac{Sxy^{(j)}}{Sxx^{(j)}}
\end{equation}

It is necessary to determine the mean for $x$ and $y$ of the
remaining $n-1$ terms
\begin{equation}
\bar{x}^{(j)}=\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i})-(x_{j})}{n-1},
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\bar{y}^{(j)}=\frac{(\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i})-(y_{j})}{n-1}.
\end{equation}

The updated intercept estimate is therefore

\begin{equation}
\hat{\beta}_{0}^{(j)}=\bar{y}^{(j)}-\hat{\beta}_{1}^{(j)}\bar{x}^{(j)}.

\subsection{Updating of Regression Estimates}
Updating techniques are used in regression analysis to add or
delete rows from a model, allowing the analyst the effect of the
observation associated with that row. In time series problems,
there will be scientific interest in the changing relationship
between variables. In cases where there a single row is to be
added or deleted, the procedure used is equivalent to a geometric
rotation of a plane.

Consider a $p \times p$ matrix $X$, from which a row $x_{i}^{T}$
is to be added or deleted. \citet{CookWeisberg} sets $A = X^{T}X$,
$a=-x_{i}^{T}$ and $b=x_{i}^{T}$, and writes the above equation as

\begin{equation}
(X^{T}X \pm x_{i}x_{i}^{T})^{-1} = \quad(X^{T}X )^{-1} \mp \quad
